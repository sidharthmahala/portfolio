A Personal portfolio using reactjs. It shows all my projects, skills, and knowledge. 
It shows my skills and knowledge using a portfolio website. The whole site is built using reactjs, redux, and styled using CSS, and hosted on vercel. The website has multiple sections where I show my projects, skills, and knowledge. The homepage shows my blog and portfolio. It also has a blog section where I write about topics I am interested in. The portfolio section has a list of projects, each with a short description and links to the projects on Github. The portfolio section is broken down into three different pages. The first one shows my skills and knowledge using a table of contents. The second page shows all my projects that are listed in chronological order from when I started working on them.
